This is the beginning of your people index.

We will add individual profiles next, such as:

- [Kevin Mitnick](../people/kevin-mitnick/)
- [Stefan Jezierski](../people/stefan-jezierski/)
- [Alison Vermaat](../people/alison-vermaat/)
- [Erik Corley](../people/erik-corley/)
- And many others to come.

Each person will eventually have their own dedicated page with:
- Biography  
- How you worked together  
- External authoritative links (Wikipedia, official sites, books, etc.)  
- Related projects  
- Timeline connections
